Port a working but old, hand-written project onto a new stack while keeping ALL of
its functionality. The danger in a rewrite is not writing the new code — it is the
half of the old system nobody remembers that silently never gets carried over, and
the behaviour that looks the same but drifts in the edge cases. This skill treats
the OLD app as the source of truth, inventories everything it does, and ports it
slice by slice — each slice verified against the old behaviour, not just a green build.

Use it for: reimplementing a legacy app on a new framework or language, splitting a
monolith onto a new stack, or any move where the goal is "same product, new
foundation" — NOT changing the old app in place (that is the `legacy-maintenance`
skill).

## Language

**Write everything you produce in English.** File names and their contents,
object names and descriptions, task titles, `## Context` and `## Verify` steps,
log entries, notes, findings, briefs, docs — all of it, always, no matter what
language the request arrived in.

This is not a style preference. These artefacts are read by people who did not
write them: a teammate on a shared model, a client opening a shared link, a
reviewer on a public repository, and the next session of Claude, which orients
from what is on disk. A model whose descriptions are half in one language and
half in another cannot be read straight through by any of them.

If a value is a proper noun — a table name, a route path, a status key, an
identifier from the code — keep it exactly as the code spells it. Translate the
prose around it, never the thing itself.

## Step 1 — Model the OLD system (your parity checklist)

The model of the old system is built in the laboratory, not on this machine. Connect
it (`GITMIR_LAB_KEY`; `gitmir_setup` says whether you are connected and how), point
it at the OLD codebase, and ask it to enumerate everything that codebase does. In a
port that enumeration is not documentation — it is the **checklist of everything that
must exist in the new app**: every piece of data, every rule that runs on it, every
endpoint, every screen, every notification and every status change. You cannot port
what you never enumerated.

With no laboratory connected the enumeration is yours to make by reading the old code,
and it has to be finished before any new code is written. An incomplete checklist is
precisely the failure this procedure exists to prevent, so say plainly that it was
made by hand.

## Step 2 — Pin the target and the stack map

Write the goal down as `PRODUCT-BRIEF.md` in the root of the new project — the file
the dashboard reads as the stated goal — or, for a port large enough to need a full
specification, produce `docs/` with `product-docs-spec` and keep the brief as its
summary. Give the brief two sections and keep them there for the whole port:

- **Decisions** — the **stack-mapping** choices, old idiom → new idiom, so they stay
  consistent across the whole port: data layer/ORM, auth, routing, state, validation,
  build.
- **Out of scope** — the old features you are deliberately NOT carrying over (dead
  code, retired flows).

A port that drops things by accident is a bug; a port that drops them on purpose is a
decision.

## Step 3 — Build the parity ledger (the core deliverable)

From that enumeration, write `tasks/port/parity.md`: one row per thing the old app
does — each piece of data, each rule, each endpoint, each screen, each notification,
each status change — named by its handle (`gm_` and ten characters) where the
laboratory issued one, with a status of `not-started` / `ported` / `verified` and its
acceptance criteria,
which is **the old behaviour**. Nothing counts as done until its row is `verified`.
This ledger is what stops the number-one failure of rewrites: half the functionality
silently missing. A feature not in the ledger is a feature you will lose.

## Step 4 — Capture the golden behaviour

The old app is the spec. For each feature, record the old system's observable
behaviour as it is TODAY — input → output — next to its ledger row. Where you can,
snapshot real outputs (API responses, computed totals, rendered states) from the
running old app so you can replay them against the new one. Never guess how the old
code behaves; read it or run it.

## Step 5 — Port in vertical slices

Cut the work by feature end-to-end — one entity with its logic, its API and its UI —
not layer by layer, so the new app is always runnable and each slice is provable.
Order slices so dependencies come first (core data and shared logic before the
screens that use them). Hand each slice to `task-planner` — one `tasks/todo/NNN-*.md`
carrying its parity rows and captured behaviour. Prefer a strangler move (the new
stack takes over feature by feature, old and new running side by side) over a
big-bang cut-over.

## Step 6 — Execute and verify against the OLD app

Run the queue with `task-runner`. For each slice:

- Replay the captured golden behaviour: the new implementation must produce the same
  output as the old for the same input. A green build is not parity — matching
  behaviour is.
- Any intended difference from the old app must be written into the brief's
  **Decisions**, not left silent. An unrecorded difference is a regression.
- Ask the laboratory to re-read the NEW repository as each slice lands, so its model
  of the new app grows with the port, and flip the slice's ledger rows to `verified`.

## Step 7 — Migrate the data (if there is a store)

If the old app has persisted data, map old schema → new (grounded in both models),
write the migration, and reconcile — row counts and a sample of records must match.
Ported code running against un-migrated data is not a finished port.

## Rules

- The parity ledger is the deliverable that makes a port safe — never skip it. What
  is not enumerated is what gets dropped.
- The OLD app is the spec: capture its real behaviour and replay it; never assume it.
- Verified means the new behaviour matches the old, not that the build is green.
- Every deviation from the old app is either a recorded decision or a bug.
- One runnable vertical slice at a time — never a stack-wide big-bang rewrite.
- Two models live at once in the laboratory: the OLD one is your parity source, the
  NEW one grows as you port. Keep both true.
